# BCNF_Decomposition_Tool
This is a Python program that performs BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) decomposition for a given relation. It allows users to input the attributes and functional dependencies of a relation and calculates the key and BCNF decomposition. The tool utilizes the closure and key counter algorithms to determine the key and perform decomposition. BCNF decomposition ensures that the resulting relations satisfy the Boyce-Codd Normal Form, which eliminates redundancy and anomalies in the database schema. The tool is useful for database administrators and developers working on database normalization and optimization.
